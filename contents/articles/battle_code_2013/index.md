In which we win great victories.

#### Description
[Battle Code](http://battlecode.org/) is a yearly competition hosted by MIT.
Competitors design an AI to control robots to lead them to battle on the virtual battlefield!
Each robot is running on a separate thread so communication between bots is limited.

After not getting around to writing an entry for 2012 I was a bit ambivalent about
participating in 2013 but after it was clear that I had a good team that was actually
going to contribute, I was in!
