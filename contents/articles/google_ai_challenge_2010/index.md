My entry to the 2010 [Planet Wars](http://planetwars.aichallenge.org/) AI competition!

<span class="more"><span>

#### Description

Planet Wars was the 2nd of a series of AI programming competitions organized
by the University of Waterloo Computer Science Club and sponsored by Google.
This was the first time programming really clicked for me!
Unfortunately they've stopped hosting competitions but I'll always look back on it fondly.

#### Code

My first foray into python and boy is it ugly! Looking at is now I'm really surprised I did well.
I guess hard work and effort count for a lot. If really want to take a look you can find the code
[here](https://github.com/bovard/planet-wars).

#### Results

I came in [79th](http://planetwars.aichallenge.org/) out of 4600 working entries.
